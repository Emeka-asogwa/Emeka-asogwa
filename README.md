## Welcome to my GitHub page

                        ✍🏽

I am Emeka, a full round Software Engineer, having fun as a Site Reliability Engineer, a graduate of Physics and Mathematics, and based in Calgary, Canada 🇨🇦. I have high interest in the Development and Operation (DevOps) of NFT Games, Blockchain, and software in general. I have the necessary tools and background knowledge, together with the experience to solve problems in this field. I am currently involved with different Web development projects. Let me know if you have project(s) to talk about, I will be happy to discuss that!
